## What is a List in C#?
A list is the C# version of an array, or rather a list of items (strings, ints or others).

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
List.Add because typically you'll need to add things to a list more often than any of the others. You're more likely to need to add stuff than anything else.
## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
I would use one of the find methods: find, findAll, findbyindex, findlast or findlastindex.
