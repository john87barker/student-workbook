## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enum are 'strongly typed constants'. Some use cases are for things that are not easily readable such as the example of volume being set for high medium and low each being used from a specific number. 

## How can you modify an Enum?
You can modify enums with EnumTricks.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
The one that comes to mind that you could easily use would be the 'open/closed' idea.
