## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
Value type- a type that holds a specific value during its existence. 
Reference type-Points to a specific spot in memory to get the data.
Pointer type- Points to the type/data to be used.

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
Value types include: bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. The main difference I notice is the wide variety of options that there are for types. Instead of num we have decimal, double, etc. This applies to a number of types given.


## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
A reference type get stored in memory by being assigned a place in memory and being called to when it is needed. Value types get a specific spot within the code that says for example y=22 and that is pulled and used in that method.
