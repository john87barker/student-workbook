## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
It is documneting what, how, and why of the code that is being used. The three mentioned in the article are ReadMe's, how to guides (including tutorials), and documentation in the code itself.
## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
Clarity for those who will use or work on the code. It allows clarity when you have to pass your code onto someone else. It also allows us to know what type of data should be passed or received.
## How important is Code documentation and why?
It really depends on who you talk to but in general it should be done alongside the actual code. It's important to get in the habit of it early so it is useful and natural as you develop more as a developer.
