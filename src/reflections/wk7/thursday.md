# Thursday

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
The pair programming was the most used as well as the UX a bit. We used the documentation but that was mostly for us to not forget to do something so I'm not sure that counts as real documentation.
## What went well?
I think we worked well together. We both drove and navigated and bounced ideas off eachother well.
## What would you do differently?
I would have planned a little more what we wanted to have happen. We planned a little but not enough in my opinion.
