Pair programming is working together with a partner. The roles are driver and navigator. The driver does the technical coding (hopefully coding out loud), while the navigator keeps the big picture in mind.

## What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
Increased code quality, better diffusion of knowledge between the team, better transfer of skills, improved resilience to disruptions. 
## What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
Imbalance of skills might lead to one partner not really being involved.
