## What are the three states of a Promise?

Pending, Resolved, Rejected

## How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

It gives it an end one way or the other. This makes the coming back and again with callback hell non existent.

## What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?

.then() tells the computer to do the next thing where as .catch() tells us to catch the outlier or the event that doesn't go through.
