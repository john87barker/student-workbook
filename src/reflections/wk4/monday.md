## What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?
'Pyramid' shape code. The main problem is that it is bad coding. There are much better ways to get things done that cause less problems.
## What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved? 
Asynchronus means that it runs in the future or not at the same time as other functions are happening. When in relation to the callback, it will just take more time to run certain functions.
## Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell
 1- Keep your code shallow. Don't have line upon line of code. Make single purpose functions and use those functions instead of long lines of code.
 2-Modularize- Use the modules like the MVC to give tasks single purpose and clarity as to what and when the function is to happen.
 3-Handle every single error. Solve the problems at the start. No sense in waiting for things to not work later on, start off by fixing what is needed.
