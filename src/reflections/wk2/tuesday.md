### What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
Arrow function expression, function declaration, and function expression. A function expression can be 'anonymous', arrow is almost a shorthand for both. 
### What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters are used when defining a function. An argument is the values received from each parameter when a function is invoked. 
### What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
A higher order function is one where it accepts another function as a parameter or when it returns a function as well. One we talked about in class today is the map function.
