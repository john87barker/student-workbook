## What is Scope ?
scope is used in respect to the placement and the availability of a variable. If it is in a function it is only accessible in the function while a variable that is not located in a function is accessible by everything that is used in the system.
## What is Hoisting ?
It is a mechanism where certain variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope before being executed. Used specifically with var (initialized) and let (not initialized). Used specifically with var (initialized) and let (not initialized). 
## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?s
const is used when a certain variable is not to be changed. let is the 'common practice' of today. You'll use let when you want to be a better developer (gospel according to Mark). Var can also be updated and re-declared like let.
