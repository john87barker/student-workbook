## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
Planning before hand saves time, energy, and a lot of reworking what you had already done. That being said, don't over plan. 

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?
Google it... Discuss it with colleagues.

## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
Biggest take away for me is to look at this again later. There's a lot of great thoughts and advice that I'm not going to remember or apply everything he talked about. I would like to use as much of it as I can.
