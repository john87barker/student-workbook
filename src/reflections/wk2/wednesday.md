## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
You can call functions, do a console log and a few other things. You should use the console log to see what a certain thing will do. While calling a function lets you see how it will respond to the site itself.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The elements tab. It can be helpful because you can adjust things there without having to go back and refresh every time. It allows other flexibility in finding what is best for the site.
## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
To use the 'debugger' function in javascript.
