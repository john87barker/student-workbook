## What is Software Development Testing?
Testing often and frequently, preferrably on small individual functions.
## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
It eliminates problems sooner and forces the developer to write better code. It helps to find exactly where the problem is rather than starting in a general spot and moving further down. Find the problem quicker and you save time and money.
## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?
Some drawbacks can include inexperience, time to create the tests, and the knowledge of how to make the tests. The last one is one that I currently struggle with. I would like to write tests for it but I'm not sure how to go about it.
