## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
It's a good show piece for interviews and allows people to see what you are capable of.
## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
Two main things: 1-a few large projects well written, 2-several small projects written 'perfectly'. The cleaner and more impressive a project the more chance of it influencing career decisions.
## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
I would include Buglog, Inspire and our first clone site. Depending on how the capstone turns out I would like to add that as well. Buglog would be good because it looks good and has some decent functionality that I'm pretty pleased with. Inspire shows the same thing but in a different set of context. The clone site because it shows where I started from.
