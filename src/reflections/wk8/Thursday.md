## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
Unit Testing, Component testing, and end to end testing. Unit Testing allows you to look at a single function or idea and test it. Component testing is where you test a complete component that is connected to the DOM (real or virtual). End to end testing is basically how the user will experience the tool being used. 
## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I think they each will have their own place when they can be most succesful but I'd probably choose the unit testing because when the building block is built right, most things tend to run smoothly as well.
## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
Again, I think they each have their place. To me I'd say that the component would seem the least useful of the three because I like the other two better. I'm sure if I understood it a bit more that would change my mind but the unit and E2E testing make the most sense to me.
