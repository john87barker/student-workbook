Day 2- CSS and HTML

What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
A Pseudo-class is a keyword/idea that can be interacted with. Common ones that I would most likely use would be: hover, target, playing (music), pausing, autofill, and probably several others that I haven't explored. 

What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity is basically the rules for what takes precedence when the page tells the computer what to show. It will allow me to make certain things stand out and take priority over others.

What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
The main issue is that if everything is important then nothing is important. If it's used once or twice the result will be fine but 15 to 50 that's a real problem.
