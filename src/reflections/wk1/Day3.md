### Day 3



### What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
Adding extra space.

### Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
Font Awesome, Google Fonts, Bootswatch, and Unsplash for resources to use. Resources to look for good ideas: https://www.spinxdigital.com/, https://www.intuit.com/, https://www.tdp-arch.com/, https://www.hubspot.com/. 

### How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
I think a well designed page is like a sigh of relief to those that visit. It's easy to find things, comfortable on the eyes and the brain and allows for a potentially stressful situation, depending on the person, to have a positive experience. 
The design could convey confidence and a sense of 'they know what they're doing'.
