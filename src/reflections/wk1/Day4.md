# What is the purpose of wire-framing?
Wire-framing is a process that is used to help outline and plan for the development of a website or other application. The purpose is to focus and direct the work of the team.

# What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
Low-fidelity is great for in meeting starts as well as to give multiple options for clients to choose from.
Mid-fidelity is similar to the low but with a little more info, including some shading and can be done on a program.
High Fidelity is a lot more detail and direction for what is going on including some images. Not usually worried about typography. 

# Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
Being married to a graphif designer the answer is yes. It is a place to start from and for which iterations and growth are easy to follow and develop. It makes starting a project, and ultimately ending a project, much easier and more effective.
