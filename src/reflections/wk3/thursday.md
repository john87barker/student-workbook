## What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
The main is keeping lots of elements synced up with the same data used throughout the program.

## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
1-Subscribe, 2- Unsubscribe, 3-Broadcast

## Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
A big benefit that I see from it is the succinct ability in which you are able to write it. The template is extremely helpful because certain aspects of our code will always be in the same place, including calling the observer. 
The 'magic' is the ability to use the observer to pull/push data from areas that are 'far away' without having to rewrite our code.
