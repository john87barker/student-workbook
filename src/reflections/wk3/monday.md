## What problem does using exports solve?
A major problem solved is that it makes it so users can't actually access certain functions which can cause issues with running the page. 
## How does export differ from export default?
Export will allow you to export any number of files while the export default only exports the one file. Both have their place.
## What is a benefit of using the Module System?
A benefit of using the module system is the organization becomes 'simple'. Each module has it's own job. When trouble shooting it allows a lot more clarity if something isn't working properly.
