## What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
Get and Set
## What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?
Set a 'trap'. You need to add two parameters, the object and the property. I could use some more talk on this subject.

## What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
The main benefit is it allows for the actual storage of data to be stay intact. The proxy is useful as it allows us to modify things in  a temporary way as we intereact with the DOM.
