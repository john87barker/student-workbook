## What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
To restrict access to certain data and methods.
## What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
One of the problems was that the objects and classes were not private. Another is that not everyone knew what the underscore notation was and caused some to delete the function and break programs.
## How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
By adding privilged info into constructor or function makes it private. (example: let x=10 while inside a function). A big reason to do this is so that we can keep the functionality of our programs to actually do what they were intended to do.
