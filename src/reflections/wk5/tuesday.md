## What are the three types of relationships?
One to one; one to many; many to many

### What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding
LInking is much more convenient and useful for the one to many relationship. It doesn't grow the document more than needed, and it helps with the return of pagination.
#### What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
Many decisions will be needed when it comes to the many to many relationships. Some of the challenges include how do the objects relate, are they related in different ways, in what ways will they be brought to the user and many other options. It seems like a very complicated way of getting things to work when they probably shouldn't work but need to work.
