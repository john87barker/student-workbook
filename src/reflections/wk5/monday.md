## What is the purpose of a Query String?
the purpose is to pass info to and from a website. The info can be stored and used in anyway that is needed.
## What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
It starts with a '?'. The format is '?item1&item2&etc. The parameters are destinguished by the '&' when adding multiple items of info in the query. 

## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
I think it would be helpful when trying to get certain data from one server to another. This can be helpful with getting large amounts of info to those who need it.
