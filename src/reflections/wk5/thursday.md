## What is a virtual property?
An 'extra' field that is usually a combination of properties or one that will make more sense to a user. For example, instead of pulling a userId it might pull a userName property instead. These do not actually exist on the DB.
## When might you use a virtual property?
As stated above you might want to pull a first and last name for the user to see/interact with but both are separate properties so you'd create a virtual property. 
## How do you search by a virtual properties value?
I think this is a trick question as these virtual properties don't really exist on the DB and therefore shouldn't be able to be searched. After scouring the text, and a quick google search, I believe I'm right but if I'm wrong please let me know how so.
