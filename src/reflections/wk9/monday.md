# Monday

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
I'm not sure how to answer this question. The technologies we are using are the computers with the nodejs and vue tools and functionality. I'm not sure what is meant about principles.

## What went well so far?
We were having good starts on the back end and some initial decisions. We are getting some of the front side done by our floater in terms of design decisions and whatnot.
## What would you do differently? Why?
I would have us rotate a little more often. Involvement on all aspects of the project would be nice to have.
