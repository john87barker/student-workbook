## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
Responsibilities for each team member will increase. The need for greater communication in a smaller group is also needed. As the article describes, potentially you'll need to run a couple different sprints at the same time.
## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
It helps keep the goal organized and the main task in mind. There are many different aspects of a project that it is easy to start something and when finished with one task to then to change gears to something really different. With running a single sprint it helps people stay focused on the main task.
## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
good service cheap won't be fast,  good service fast won't be cheap, and fast service cheap won't be good. It gives the team a direction as to what is wanted by the product owner. If they want speed, they'll get it, if they want good then they'll get it.
