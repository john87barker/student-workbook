## What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?
They are things that are just outside the scope of actually happening (Just before or after in most cases.). They are point in time that you can extract data is my understanding. They make it so you can see when things exactly happen.
## How have you utilized lifcycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
I have absolutely no idea.
## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
They are hooks that let you access a component right before or right after the first rendering of a page. The text says "Use mounting hooks if you need to access or modify the DOM of your component immediately before or after the initial render." I'm not sure when or why you would need to do that. It sounds useful but I'm not sure how.
