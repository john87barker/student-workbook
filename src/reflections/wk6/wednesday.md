## What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?
They are things that are just outside the scope of actually happening (Just before or after in most cases.). They are point in time that you can extract data is my understanding. They make it so you can see when things exactly happen.
## How have you utilized lifcycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
I have absolutely no idea.
## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
