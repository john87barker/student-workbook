## What is Component based architecture?
A framework which is built of smaller segments that are functional all on their own.
## What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
Parts are interchangeable which will be super handy. It makes it also useful in working on a page. When you have to refresh everytime you make an adjustment this will save a lot of time and patience. 
## What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
Readability can become an issue. Instead of sprikling the project it is often smeared on.
