## What is a nested route?
It is a route that is nested in a parent element that often has multiple routes.
## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
A great time to use this is when you want to offer different options for users to search. For example: when you want to learn about a certain musician and want to see their tour schedule as well as past events. 
## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
Based on the way the questions are asked I want to say yes you can. In the reading I don't see an answer either way but it would make sense that you could.
